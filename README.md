## Description

This course covers advanced front-end technologies. It enables students
to acquire current knowledge about these technologies and get up to date
on technologies likely to be used in the labour market.

## Modality

This course is conducted online synchronously. Team classroom links will
be provided before class. Unless otherwise specified, attendance is
mandatory for each class. Lectures will not be recorded. If you are
absent, it is your responsibility to compensate for the missed session.

Unfortunately, I am unable to offer office hours. All meetings must take
place during scheduled class time. Outside of class periods, you can
reach me through MIO or Teams at any time. Please allow 24 to 48 hours
for me to respond.

## Pedagogical approach

Classes will consist of a blend of lectures, live coding sessions, and
exercises. Readings, lecture notes and examples will be provided through
GitHub.

## Assessments

Please note that assignments are assessed based on your comprehension of
the material covered in class. While you may consult supplementary
resources, your primary focus should remain on the concepts and methods
presented in the lecture notes.

### Homework (10%)

Homework assignments are meant to encourage continuous progress in
acquiring the course competencies. Their content is not graded. Students
who submit them on time receive a perfect grade.

### Exams (4 × 10%)

Exams are similar in scope to homework assignments, but their content is
graded. They aim to assess students' understanding of one or two
concepts at most, and allow the teacher to provide rapid feedback.

#### Competency assessed

- EHP1 2. Process data related to animated and interactive web
  interfaces

### Project (20%)

The project is designed to assess students' understanding of the
learning material. As such, it's graded based on the level of
proficiency students exhibit for the course competencies. Students have
two weeks to complete and submit the project.

#### Competency assessed

- EHP1 2. Process data related to animated and interactive web
  interfaces

### LIA (30%)

Each course includes a Learning Integration Assessment (LIA) that
attests to students' achievement of the course-level learning outcome
that is the main knowledge, skills, and attitudes to be developed.

#### Competencies assessed

- EHP1 2. Process data related to animated and interactive web
  interfaces
- EHP2 3. Respond to web browser requests

#### Assessment criteria

- Program design
  - requirements are met
  - program flow is decomposed into manageable, logical pieces
  - data structures are appropriate
  - common code is unified, not duplicated
  - appropriate algorithms are used, and coded cleanly
  - APIs are used correctly
  - markup is semantic
  - no global variables

- Readability
  - constants are used instead of hard-coded values
  - complex or meaningful expressions are named
  - naming is consistent and descriptive
  - inline comments are used to explain reasoning when necessary
  - documentation is correct
  - code is well formatted

- Version control
  - commits contain related changes
  - messages are consistent and informative

### Student Proficiency in the Language of Instruction (SPLI)

> Student proficiency in the language of instruction is the ability to
> write, read, speak, and listen in order to communicate effectively at
> the college level. SPLI may also require discipline-specific
> vocabulary, documentation, and communication skills; assessment of
> language skills must account for a minimum of 10% of any take-home
> written assignment or oral presentation in which English is the
> language of expression.

Documenting source code is an integral part of software development.
Clear and well written documentation makes it easier for others
(including your future self) to understand a program, maintain it, and
troubleshoot issues. Accordingly, 10% of the total grade will be devoted
to the assessment of students' proficiency in the language of
instruction. Variable and function names will be assessed for
consistency and correctness, while comments will be assessed for
accuracy and helpfulness.

### Late Submission Policy

Homework submitted during or after the next class will not be accepted,
resulting in a score of 0. For other types of submissions, no penalties
will be applied if prior arrangements were made with the teacher _before
the submission deadline_. However, if an assessment is submitted after
the deadline without prior arrangements, a deduction of 5% per day will
be applied to the best possible grade.

### Plagiarism

> Cheating and plagiarism are violations of academic integrity and are
> considered to be very serious academic offenses. They undermine the
> legitimacy of the academic degrees awarded by the College and deny
> honest students of some of the rewards of their efforts.
>
> Plagiarism is submitting or presenting work in a course as if it were
> the student's own original and individual work done expressly for that
> course when, in fact, it is not.
>
> The penalty for plagiarism or cheating is a grade of zero for that
> course work or assignment without the possibility of revising that
> course work or assignment or preparing an alternate assignment.

#### Generative AI

In this course, you may not submit any work generated by an AI program
such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot as your own. Doing so constitutes
plagiarism. If there are doubts regarding the provenance of your work,
you may be required to explain and reason through your code.
